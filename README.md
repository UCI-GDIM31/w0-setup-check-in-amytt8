# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Amy, I go by she/her prounouns and I'm from LA but I was born in Vietnam. My hobbies are drawing, collecting Sonny Angels, and reading lots of manga in my free time. I enjoy playing games like Minecaft but lately I've been playing a game called Identity V, which is a mobile game. I'm taking this class since it is a reqiured GDIM major class. I do not have any prior expreience with game devlopment or coding. I'm not sure what games I'm hoping to bulid but I hope its a super fun one.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
What I'm hoping to get out of this class is having a greater understanding of what elements make up game development and understanding what goes on behind the scene of making a game.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
Yes, I'm nervous about this class because I have no experience in coding and I don't think I'm a huge fan of coding either. 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.
